Queue-Fair Adapter Magento Installation Guide

Queue-Fair can be added to any Magento installation easily in minutes.  You will need a Queue-Fair account - please visit https://queue-fair.com/free-trial if you don't already have one.  You should also have received our Technical Guide.

--------------------- Client Side JavaScript Adapter ------------------------
Most of our customers prefer to use the Client Side JavaScript Adapter, which is suitable for all sites that wish solely to protect against overload.

To add the Queue-Fair Client Side JavaScript Adapter, you don't need the PHP files included in this extension.

Instead, perform the following steps:

1) Login as Admin
2) Select Content -> Configuration from the left navigation.
3) To add the Adapter to all pages on your Magento site, tap Edit for the Global record
4) In Other Settings, expand HTML Head
5) In Scripts and Style Sheets, copy and paste the following line of code:

<script data-queue-fair-client="CLIENT_NAME" src="https://files.queue-fair.net/queue-fair-adapter.js"></script>

6) Replace CLIENT_NAME with the account system name visibile on the Account -> Your Account page of the Queue-Fair Portal
7) Save Configuration
8) Flush Cache when prompted

You shoud now see the Adapter tag when you perform View Source after refreshing your pages.

There is a helpful video of these steps in action at https://magefan.com/blog/how-to-add-custom-code-in-html-head

And you're done!  Your queues and activation rules can now be configured in the Queue-Fair Portal.

----------------------- Server Side Adapter -----------------------------------

The Server Side Adapter means that your Magento server communicates directly with the Queue-Fair servers, rather than your visitors' browsers.

This can introduce a dependency between our systems, which is why most customers prefer the Client Side Adapter.

The Server Side Adapter is preferred in the following use cases:
	- where you have technically skilled visitors or high value limited quantity product, and people may attempt to skip the queue, OR
	- where it is anticipated that your web server will not cope with the volume of traffic to your home or landing page, AND
		- you do not or cannot use the Direct Link integration method (see Technical Guide).

The Server Side Adapter is a small PHP library that will run (at least) the first time each visitor accesses your site.  If it determines that the visitor should be queued, the visitor is sent to our Queue Servers and execution and generation of the page for the HTTP request for that visitor will cease.  If it determines that the visitor should not be queued, it sets a cookie to indicate that the visitor has been processed and your page executes and shows as normal.

Thus the Server Side Adapter prevents visitors from skipping the queue by disabling the Client Side JavaScript Adapter, and also reduces load on your Magento server when things get busy.

To install the Server Side Adapter:

You will need PHP version 5.4 or above.

1) Go to your Magento installation:

	cd /path/to/magento

2) Add the Server Side extension to your composer requirements:

	composer require queue-fair/adapter:2.5.3 --no-update

3) Update composer
	composer update

1) Copy queue-fair-adapter.php AND queue-fair-adapter-library.php into your web directory (DocumentRoot on Apache).

2) Edit queue-fair-adapter.php and set your account name and account secret to the account System Name and Account Secret shown on the Your Account page of the Queue-Fair portal.

3) Create a readable, writable and executable folder so that your Queue-Fair settings can be locally saved (necessary for performance of your web server under load):

mkdir /path/to/settings
chmod 777 /path/to/settings

	The executable permission is needed on the folder so that the Adapter can examine its contents.  You can see your Queue-Fair settings in the Portal File Manager - they are updated when you hit Make Live.

4) Change the settingsFileCacheLocation in queue-fair-adapter.php to match the folder path from 3)

5) Note the settingsFileCacheLifetimeMinutes setting - this is how often your web server will check for updated settings from the Queue-Fair queue servers (which change when you hit Make Live).
	The default value is 5 minutes.  You can set this to -1 to disable local caching but DON'T DO THIS on your production machine/live queue with real people, or your server may collapse under load.

6) Note the adapterMode setting.  "safe" is recommended - we also support "simple" - see the Technical Guide for further details.

7) Note the debug setting - this is set to true in the version we send you, BUT:  
	You MUST set debug to false on production machines/live queues as otherwise your web logs will rapidly become full - but you can set it to a single IP address to just output debug information for a single visitor.

	If using Apache, use

		 tail -f /var/log/apache2/my-apache-error.log | sed 's/\\n/\n/g'

	to see the debug messages, where my-apache-error.log is the apache error log filename set in your VirtualHost.  By default it's "error_log" or "error.log".

8) VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure the system clock on your webserver is accurately set to network time! On unix systems, this is usually done with the ntp package.  It doesn't matter which timezone you are using.


----------------------------------

To add the Server-Side Adapter to your pages, add 

include "queue-fair-adapter.php"

to the TOP of the pages you wish to protect.   The Adapter MUST run before any characters are output by the rest of your system, as otherwise it cannot set the necessary cookies.  So, the added line should usually be the FIRST line, before the opening HTML or DOCTYPE tag is written, like this:

<?php
include "queue-fair-adapter.php";

//Rest of header PHP

//Rest of page
?><!DOCTYPE html><html>...

In the case where the Adapter sends the request elsewhere (for example to show the user a queue page), the exit() method is called by the Adapter and the rest of the page will NOT be generated, which means it isn't sent to the visitor's browser, which makes it secure.

---------------------------------

To test the Server-Side Adapter:

Use a queue that is not in use on other pages, or create a new queue for testing.


Testing SafeGuard:

Set up an Activtion Rule to match the page you wish to test.  Hit Make Live.  Go to the Settings page for the queue.  Put it in SafeGuard mode.  Hit Make Live again.

In a new Private Browsing window, visit the page on your site.  

- Verify that you can see debug output from the Adapter in your error-log.
- Verify that a cookie has been created named Queue-Fair-Pass-queuename, where queuename is the System Name of your queue
	- If the Adapter is in Safe mode, also verify that a cookie has been created named QueueFair-Store-accountname, where accountname is the System Name of your account (on the Your Account page on the portal).
	- If the Adapter is in Simple mode, the Queue-Fair-Store cookie is not created.
- Hit Refresh.  Verify that the cookie(s) have not changed their values.

Testing Queue:

Go back to the Portal and put the queue in Demo mode on the Queue Settings page.  Hit Make Live.  Delete any Queue-Fair-Pass cookies from your browser.  In a new tab, visit https://accountname.queue-fair.net , and delete any Queue-Fair-Pass or Queue-Fair-Data cookies that appear there.  Refresh the page that you have visited on your site.
- Verify that you are now sent to queue.
- When you come back to the page from the queue, verify that a new QueueFair-Pass-queuename cookie has been created.
	- If the Adapter is in Safe mode, also verify that the QueueFair-Store cookie has not changed its value.
- Hit Refresh.  Verify that you are not queued again.  Verify that the cookies have not changed their values.


IMPORTANT:  Once you are sure the Server-Side Adapter is working as expected, remove the Client-Side JavaScript Adapter tag from your pages, and don't forget to disable debug level logging in queue-fair-adapter.php, and also set settingsFileCacheLifetimeMinutes to at least 5.

---------------------------------

For maximum security:

The Server Side Adapter contains multiple checks to prevent visitors bypassing the queue, either by tampering with set cookie values or query strings, or by sharing this information with each other.  When a tamper is detected, the visitor is treated as a new visitor, and will be sent to the back of the queue if people are queuing.

	- The Server Side Adapter checks that Passed Cookies and Passed Strings presented by web browsers have been signed by our Queue-Server.  It uses the Secret visible on each queue's Settings page to do this.
		If you change the queue Secret, this will invalidate everyone's cookies and also cause anyone in the queue to lose their place, so modify with care!

	- The Server Side Adapter also checks that Passed Strings coming from our Queue Server to your web server were produced within the last 30 seconds, which is why your clock must be accurately set.

	- The Server Side adapater also checks that passed cookies were produced within the time limit set by Passed Lifetime on the queue Settings page, to prevent visitors trying to cheat by tampering with cookie expiration times or sharing cookie values.  So, the Passed Lifetime should be set to long enough for your visitors to complete their transaction, plus an allowance for those visitors that are slow, but no longer.

	- The signature also includes the visitor's USER_AGENT, to further prevent visitors from sharing cookie values.

	- The Adapter is by default configured to let known 'good' bots through without any checks (such as the Google Spider).  For maximum security we recommend removing the good bot check by performing the commment operation indicated in queue-fair-adapter.php while people are likely to be queueing, and then reinstating it afterwards.
